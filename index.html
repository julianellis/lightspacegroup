				<div class="overview">
					<h3>Peppard Common</h3>
					<p>This opportunity came as an infill of land with a small but substantial brick & flint shed sited towards the front of the property.  Located close to Henley-on-Thames and sold to us by agents with planning consent for the demolition of the existing building and erection of a single new 4 bedroom house.  It was imminently clear the overall internal design had been poorly conceived and offered considerable scope for improvement by increasing the habitable footprint through the creation of an upper floor at the rear and reconfiguring the layout so as to open up the interior and allow substantially more light to penetrate into the heart of the building, aided by the creation of a central double height space.  
						<br /><br /> only relatively small changes needed to be made to the exterior look of the property, we were able to achieve our internal redesign by applying for the changes as Non-Material Amendments (NMA), thereby saving time and expense.

					<h3>Peckham Rye</h3>
					<p>This was a project we could really get our teeth into.  It had at onetime been a Bank with 3,800sq.ft. of floor space, but we were able to convert it, under ‘Permitted Development’, into 7 very special apartments, by adapting the considerable ceiling height on the ground floor, inserting a mezzanine floor with double height aspects and also converting the existing pitched roof into a mansard.  The works were extensive but the end result was impressive.  An added bonus was that we also achieve planning for a further 7 new build apartments on the land at the rear as this, conveniently, had frontage onto another road.  After some deliberation though, we decided to sell this on with the planning gain.</p>

					<h3>South Eden Park Rd</h3>
					<p>Originally a gate lodge to a large manor house now demolished, this property was suffering badly from subsidence resulting from the nearby cedar tree roots and, although locally listed, was semi-derelict when we acquired it. Planning consent was obtained to knock down the ugly 1960's 'add-ons' at the rear and rebuild that part in the prevalent 'Arts &amp; Crafts' style, creating a contemporary open plan and spacious 3 bedroom cottage in a landscaped garden.</p>

					<h3>Lavender Hill</h3>
					<p>We purchased this building from Wandsworth Council who had acquired it under a Compulsory Purchase Order as the previous owner had allowed it to become derelict over a period of 20 years; consequently, it was in a very sad state. By converting the loft into a habitable space we created a total of 4 units; - a shop on the ground floor; 2 split level apartments above; and 1 mews house spread over 3 floors to the rear.</p>

				<h2>Investors</h2>
				<h3>Private investors</h3>
				<p>With some of our projects we involve private investors seeking an attractive return on their capital within a defined time frame. The rate of return we offer far eclipses those offered by banks, pension schemes and other investment houses.</p>
				<h3 class="spaced">Types of opportunity</h3>
				<p>Depending on the scale of the development opportunity, an investor can often expect to see a return on their original capital within a year where smaller projects are concerned.</p>
				<p>Opportunities that are greater in scale, i.e. a development producing multiple units, are more likely to be over a longer period of time, but will inevitably offer larger returns.</p>
				<p>For more information on how we work with private investors, please contact Damien Birtwistle.</a></p>
